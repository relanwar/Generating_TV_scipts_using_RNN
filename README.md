# Generating_TV_scipts_using_RNN
Generating TV scipts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)  This project is about generating self Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new, "fake" TV script. This project is the third requirement to graduate from Udacity's Deep learning Nano-degree.
