# Generating TV scipts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This project is about generating self Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new, "fake" TV script. This project is the third requirement to graduate from Udacity's Deep learning Nano-degree.

My code passed all the unit tests as well as the rubric aiming for a loss less than 3.5

Hyperparameters: sequence_length = 8, learning_rate = 0.001, CrossEntropyLoss
embedding_dim = 256, hidden_dim = 512 , n_layers = 2
Parameters:   batch_size = 128, epochs = 8
 
My output:
Loss: 3.1873
